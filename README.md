I was born on August 13th, 1998 in Idaho.
On November 28th, 2000, my younger brother, Kevin, was born.
Before my eighth birthday, my family moved to Texas where I spent most of my life.
While living in Idaho, I learned how to play the piano and when my family moved to Texas I learned how to play the violin.

I am (unfortunately) allergic to:
1. Cats
2. Strawberries
3. All trees native to Texas
4. All grasses native to Texas

My favorite book is "Written in Red" by Anne Bishop.
